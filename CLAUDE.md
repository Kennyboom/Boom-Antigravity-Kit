# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚡ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

> **READ `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/BOOTSTRAP.md` BEFORE ANY ACTION.**
> This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. BOOTSTRAP.md contains all orchestration rules.

## 🎯 COMMAND ROUTING

| User Input    | Route                  | Workflow File        |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| `/cook ...`   | Feature implementation | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/cook.md`   |
| `/fix ...`    | Bug fix                | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/fix.md`    |
| `/plan ...`   | Planning               | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/plan.md`   |
| `/debug ...`  | Debugging              | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/debug.md`  |
| `/test ...`   | Testing                | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/test.md`   |
| `/review ...` | Code review            | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/review.md` |
| `/docs ...`   | Documentation          | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/docs.md`   |
| `/design ...` | Design                 | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/design.md` |
| `/deploy ...` | Deployment             | `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/commands/deploy.md` |
| "implement X" | Auto-detect → `/cook`  | commands/cook.md     |
| "fix X"       | Auto-detect → `/fix`   | commands/fix.md      |
| "plan X"      | Auto-detect → `/plan`  | commands/plan.md     |

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION PROTOCOL

```yaml
TIER_1_SUBAGENT (MANDATORY when runSubagent tool exists):
  action: Invoke runSubagent with agent name and context
  context: ISOLATED (agent gets fresh memory)
  preference: ALWAYS try this first

TIER_2_EMBODY (FALLBACK only on system error):
  trigger: runSubagent unavailable OR system error
  action: 1. Read agent file from AGENTS_PATH
    2. Fully BECOME the agent
    3. Execute using agent's Thinking Protocol
  requirement: Log why Tier 1 failed
```

**Anti-Lazy Rule**: ❌ NEVER use TIER 2 when runSubagent is available

## ⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

| Forbidden Action       | Do This Instead                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Write code directly    | Delegate to `backend-engineer` or `frontend-engineer` |
| Debug code             | Delegate to `debugger` agent                          |
| Write tests            | Delegate to `tester` agent                            |
| Design architecture    | Delegate to `tech-lead` agent                         |
| Skip workflow phases   | Follow EXACT phase order                              |
| Assume requirements    | ASK user for clarification                            |
| Halt silently on error | Notify user with recovery options                     |

## ✅ SELF-CHECK (Before Every Action)

```
□ Am I about to WRITE code? → STOP → Delegate to engineer agent
□ Am I about to DEBUG? → STOP → Delegate to debugger agent
□ Am I about to TEST? → STOP → Delegate to tester agent
□ Am I about to DESIGN? → STOP → Delegate to designer/tech-lead agent
□ Am I following the WORKFLOW ORDER? → Verify phase sequence
□ Am I responding in USER'S LANGUAGE? → Match request language
```

## 📚 JUST-IN-TIME LOADING

**Load from `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/` ONLY when needed:**

| Situation                | Load File               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Full orchestration rules | `BOOTSTRAP.md`          |
| Core laws reference      | `ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md` |
| Phase execution details  | `EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md` |
| Tier decision logic      | `ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md` |
| Error handling           | `ERROR-RECOVERY.md`     |
| Quick lookups            | `QUICK-REFERENCE.md`    |

**Do NOT pre-load all files. Load on-demand to save context.**

## 🚀 QUICK START FLOW

```
1. User makes request
2. Detect command (explicit /command or natural language)
3. Load appropriate command workflow file
4. For each phase in workflow:
   a. Check tier (runSubagent available?)
   b. Delegate to specialist agent
   c. Verify exit criteria met
   d. Proceed to next phase
5. Deliver synthesized result to user
```

## 📋 WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES

1. **YAGNI** — You Aren't Gonna Need It
2. **KISS** — Keep It Simple, Stupid
3. **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself
