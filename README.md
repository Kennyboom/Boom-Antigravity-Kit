# Boom Boom Antigravity Kit V5.0

> Forked from [vudovn/antigravity-kit](https://github.com/vudovn/antigravity-kit) with BWF quality gates integration.

The next-generation autonomous engineering toolkit. V5.0 delivers disciplined engineering protocols that ensure **zero feature omissions** through systematic discovery, mandatory coverage audits, and build verification loops.

## What's New in V5.0

### 🆕 New Features
- **`/architect` workflow** — 10-phase technical design (C4, ADR, DB, API, Screen Specs, Error Handling, Caching)
- **`solution-architect` agent** — Technical architect for system design before implementation
- **`/save` + `/recap` workflows** — Session persistence across conversations
- **4 quality rules** — `anti-skip`, `5-ui-states`, `coverage-audits`, `feature-discovery`
- **Design Thinking reference** — Extracted to `.shared/` for reuse

### ✨ Upgraded Features
- **`/plan`** → Feature Discovery Engine + Given/When/Then AC + Edge Cases + Plan Coverage Audit
- **`/create`** → Code Blueprint + Anti-Skip Protocol + Build Verify Loop + Code Coverage Audit
- **`/enhance`** → Anti-Skip Lite + Build Verify Loop
- **`project-planner`** → Feature Discovery + Coverage Audit integration
- All original V2.0 agents, skills, and scripts retained

  └── Plan Coverage Audit
```

## Getting Started

Copy the `.agent` directory into your project root:

```bash
# Start a new structured project plan
/plan [your project description]

# Architect your system based on your plan
/architect

# Start implementation with anti-skip verification
/create
```

## Three Coverage Audits

| Audit | When | Checks |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Plan Coverage** | After `/plan` | Feature + CRUD + Sub-feature + Cross-cut |
| **Design Coverage** | After `/architect` | Entity + API + Screen + Error + ADR |
| **Code Coverage** | After `/create` | Spec + Build + Lint + States + Error |

All audits are **MANDATORY**. No handover without PASS.

## Architecture

See [`.agent/ARCHITECTURE.md`](.agent/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full technical breakdown.
